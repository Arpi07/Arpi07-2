The entire architecture consists of two stream. One is main stream and the other part is shape stream. The dual rask loss function is used to train the entire model.


Follwing steps are needed to use the code- 

1. Create one root directory named Attention_cnn. Then create another three sub-directories, namely, Data, model and train within that root directory. Also, keep datasets_utils.py under root directory.

2. Keep Get_Dataset.py, Data_Process.py and Get_Dataset_utils.py within Data sub-directory.

3. Keep Resnet50_m.py, Network.py and Def_Model.py within model sub-directory.

4. Keep Data_Prep.py, training_utils.py, Loss_Dual.py, Train_and_Eval.py and Train_Model.py within train sub-directory. 


Packages required to run the following code:
PIL
Tensorflow 2.0
Keras
Matplotlib
Numpy
Scipy
imageio
